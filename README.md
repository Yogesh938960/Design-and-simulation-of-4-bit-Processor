# Design and simulation of 4-bit Processor
To design, implement, and simulate a 4-bit processor as described in your guidelines, here’s a structured approach leveraging Verilog and recommended visualization with waveform simulation tools:

## 1. Custom 4-Bit Instruction Set
A 4-bit processor typically uses a simple, load/store architecture. With 4 opcode bits, you have up to 16 instructions. Here is an example set inspired by classic educational and open-project CPUs:

Sources use 4-bit opcodes and register addressing, supporting up to four 4-bit registers for simplicity.

## 2. Key Modules and Sample Verilog Ideas
### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
Implements basic arithmetic and logic on 4-bit data. Here’s an example for a 4-bit ALU with several operations:
'''
module alu_4bit(
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input [2:0] opcode,
    output reg [3:0] result,
    output reg zero, carry
);
always @(*) begin
    case (opcode)
        3'b000: {carry, result} = a + b;   // ADD
        3'b001: {carry, result} = a - b;   // SUB
        3'b010: result = a & b;            // AND
        3'b011: result = a | b;            // OR
        3'b100: result = a ^ b;            // XOR
        default: result = 4'b0000;
    endcase
    zero = (result == 4'b0000);
end
endmodule
'''
