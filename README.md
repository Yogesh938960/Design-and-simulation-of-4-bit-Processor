# Design and simulation of 4-bit Processor
To design, implement, and simulate a 4-bit processor as described in your guidelines, here’s a structured approach leveraging Verilog and recommended visualization with waveform simulation tools:

## 1. Custom 4-Bit Instruction Set
A 4-bit processor typically uses a simple, load/store architecture. With 4 opcode bits, you have up to 16 instructions. Here is an example set inspired by classic educational and open-project CPUs:

Sources use 4-bit opcodes and register addressing, supporting up to four 4-bit registers for simplicity.

## 2. Key Modules and Sample Verilog Ideas

### A. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
Implements basic arithmetic and logic on 4-bit data. Here’s an example for a 4-bit ALU with several operations:
```
module alu_4bit(
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input [2:0] opcode,
    output reg [3:0] result,
    output reg zero, carry
);
always @(*) begin
    case (opcode)
        3'b000: {carry, result} = a + b;   // ADD
        3'b001: {carry, result} = a - b;   // SUB
        3'b010: result = a & b;            // AND
        3'b011: result = a | b;            // OR
        3'b100: result = a ^ b;            // XOR
        default: result = 4'b0000;
    endcase
    zero = (result == 4'b0000);
end
endmodule
```

### B. Register File
A small set of registers, each 4 bits:
```
module reg_file(
    input clk,
    input write_en,
    input [1:0] write_addr,
    input [3:0] write_data,
    input [1:0] read_addr,
    output [3:0] read_data
);
reg [3:0] registers [3:0];
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (write_en)
        registers[write_addr] <= write_data;
end
assign read_data = registers[read_addr];
endmodule
```

### C. Control Unit
A hardwired FSM distinguishes instructions and generates control signals for ALU, registers, program counter, and memory. The main logic is a case statement mapping opcode to control lines. Example skeleton:
```
module control_unit(
    input [3:0] opcode,
    output reg alu_op,
    output reg mem_read, mem_write,
    output reg reg_write, pc_write
);
// Opcode decoding and corresponding controls
always @(*) begin
    case (opcode)
        4'b0001: begin // LOAD
            mem_read = 1; reg_write = 1; alu_op = 3'bXXX;
        end
        // ... Others
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
We’ll specify all 16 opcodes with combinational logic for control lines.

### D. Memory
For testing, implement as a small synchronous RAM:
```
module memory(
    input clk,
    input [3:0] addr,
    input [3:0] data_in,
    input write_en,
    output reg [3:0] data_out
);
reg [3:0] mem [15:0]; // 16 x 4 bits, example size
always @(posedge clk)
    if (write_en)
        mem[addr] <= data_in;
    else
        data_out <= mem[addr];
endmodule
```
Small 16-location RAM is typical for 4-bit CPUs

## 3. Simulation and Waveform Visualization
Testbench: Write a Verilog testbench simulating instruction fetch, decode, and execute for multiple instructions.

Visualization: Use tools like GTKWave, ModelSim, or Vivado to view RTL and simulation waveforms.

Observe the sequence of instruction decode, register/memory updates, and ALU computation.

Track clk, opcode, register file values, data bus, and ALU outputs.

Key waveforms: PC, instruction, alu_result, registers, memory, zero/carry flags.

Example testbench snippet for ALU:
```
initial begin
   a = 4'b0011; b = 4'b0101; opcode = 3'b000; #10;
   a = 4'b1001; b = 4'b0011; opcode = 3'b001; #10;
   ...
end
```

Visualized in GTKWave to verify correct operations.

### Conclusion
Compose: Integrate your ALU, register file, control unit, and memory per your architecture.

Write Verilog modules for each, connect in a CPU top module.

Simulate: Develop a testbench to run sample programs/operations, capture outputs.

Visualize: Use simulation tools to see data flow and debug.

This structure ensures address all guideline requirements for a 4-bit processor, including a custom ISA, modular design, Verilog coding, and waveform-based verification.
